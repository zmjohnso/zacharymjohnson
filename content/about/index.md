## Career

I launched my professional career in February, 2021 at the software consultancy Atomic Object. While at Atomic I have worked on multiple projects with a variety of tech stacks, including React/Node and Angular/.NET Core projects. In addition to this site, my writings can be found on the Atomic Object blog, known as [Spin](https://spin.atomicobject.com/author/zach-johnson/).

## Interests

My technical interests include all things web development, Bitcoin and Austrian economics. When away from the computer I enjoy running and balance sports.
